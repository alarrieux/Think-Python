# Exercise 3.3
# Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('allen') is 5. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.

def Length_String(str):
  counter = 0
  for i in str:
    counrter += 1
  return counter
  
  print(Length_String('Ashley')
   # you can choose to use the following instead: Length_String('Ashley')
